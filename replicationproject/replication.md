## Banana Keyboard ##
The project that I have replicated is the Banana Keyboard project.

## Six Related projects ##
Here are six projects that are related to the chosen project.

### Related project 1: Tuning game ###
Are you in tune?

https://microbit.hackster.io/FrauHmpf/are-you-in-tune-895805

This project is related to mine because it invloves making and adjusting various music notes by simply touching an object that is connected to the Microbit. That object can be anything, ranging from a ukelele to a dog figurine, as long you are *also* touching the croco-clip-connector-thing that is attached to it.

### Related project 2: Understanding a liar better with Microbit ###
MicroBit Lie Detector

https://tinkercademy.com/tutorials/microbit-lie-detector/

This project is related to mine because invloves understanding how the human body sort of conducts various energies depending on whether the person is lying or not. Like I've mentioned before, it requires touching ~~(weird, huh)~~.

### Related project 3: Just playin' with som SeraTONEs ###
Tone player

This project is related to mine because it's similar to creating various tones with different speakers other than the ones that come packaged with the kit.

### Related project 4: Haha speaker go buzz buzz ###
Peizo Buzzer

This project is related to mine because it has buzzer. And having a buzzer to help create music with all this coding and stuff, you can make a Peizzo Buzzer too.

### Related project 5: A guitar. Really? A guitar? ###
Microbit Guitar

This project is related to mine because you get to play with with music. Being able to interact with the tone of the guitar while mauvering it is creative and makes me want to improvise upon it.


### Related project 6: A love meter... oh lovely! ###
Microbit Love Meter

This project is related to mine because it it relies on basically understanding what eletric bits in our bodies to get a result on the contraption we are working with.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

What I initially thought that you could do anything that experiments with experiences in technology.

The idea is that experience is very important to improvements; knowing was it good, bad or boring. It is also vital to us that understanding how to thoughtfully figure out how to capably maneuver tenchnological objects, figuring out which part goes where and the like; and most importantly the conceptual model of the system.

I'd like to learn more about how affordance works with everyday technologies; and I also want to learn more about how designers and metors deep differ from each other.

I think this relates to how I wan to plan out each and every single little subject that interacts with the one main, primary object that keeps these thigns intact and all.

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

This does not have any information.

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

![Image](missingimage.png)

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

It's a thing for anyone.

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*
