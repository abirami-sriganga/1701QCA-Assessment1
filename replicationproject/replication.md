https://microbit.hackster.io/FrauHmpf/are-you-in-tune-895805

This project is related to mine because it invloves making and adjusting various music notes by simply touching an object that is connected to the Microbit. That object can be anything, ranging from a ukelele to a dog figurine, as long you are *also* touching the croco-clip-connector-thing that is attached to it.

### Related project 2: Understanding a liar better with Microbit ###

This project is related to mine because invloves understanding how the human body sort of conducts various energies depending on whether the person is lying or not. Like I've mentioned before, it requires touching ~~(weird, huh)~~.

This project is related to mine because it's similar to creating various tones with different speakers other than the ones that come packaged with the kit.

### Related project 4: Haha speaker go buzz buzz ###

This project is related to mine because it has buzzer. And having a buzzer to help create music with all this coding and stuff, you can make a Peizzo Buzzer too.

### Related project 5: A guitar. Really? A guitar? ###

This project is related to mine because you get to play with with music. Being able to interact with the tone of the guitar while mauvering it is creative and makes me want to improvise upon it.


### Related project 6: A love meter... oh lovely! ###

This project is related to mine because it it relies on basically understanding what eletric bits in our bodies to get a result on the contraption we are working with.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

What I initially thought that you could do anything that experiments with experiences in technology.

The idea is that experience is very important to improvements; knowing was it good, bad or boring. It is also vital to us that understanding how to thoughtfully figure out how to capably maneuver tenchnological objects, figuring out which part goes where and the like; and most importantly the conceptual model of the system.

I'd like to learn more about how affordance works with everyday technologies; and I also want to learn more about how designers and metors deep differ from each other.

I think this relates to how I wan to plan out each and every single little subject that interacts with the one main, primary object that keeps these thigns intact and all.
